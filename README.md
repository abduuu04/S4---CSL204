## CSL204: Operating Systems Lab

This repository contains the programs and resources developed during the CSL204 Operating Systems Lab sessions.

### Purpose

This repository serves as a central hub for sharing and referencing the lab programs and resources created in CSL204. It aims to:

- **Facilitate collaboration:** Students can access and share code and resources with each other, enabling better understanding and troubleshooting.
- **Maintain a record of work:** Programs and resources are preserved for future reference and revision.
- **Promote learning:** Sharing and reviewing code and resources promotes knowledge exchange and reinforces key operating systems concepts.

### Repository Structure

The repository is organized into folders corresponding to each lab session topic:

- **Bankers Algorithm:** Contains programs and resources related to implementing and simulating the Banker's algorithm for deadlock prevention.
- **Disk Scheduling:** Contains programs and resources related to implementing various disk scheduling algorithms like FCFS, SSTF, SCAN, etc.
- **IPC Semaphore:** Contains programs and resources related to implementing and using semaphores for inter-process communication and synchronization.
- **IPC shm:** Contains programs and resources related to using shared memory for inter-process communication.
- **Memory Allocation:** Contains programs and resources related to implementing various memory allocation algorithms like fixed-size partitioning, variable-size partitioning, buddy system, etc.
- **Page Replacement:** Contains programs and resources related to implementing various page replacement algorithms like FIFO, LRU, OPT, etc.
- **Process Scheduling:** Contains programs and resources related to implementing various process scheduling algorithms like FCFS, SJF, Priority, etc.
- **Shell programs:** Contains shell scripts written for various tasks related to process management, file system manipulation, etc.
- **System Calls:** Contains programs and resources related to using various system calls for file operations, process management, etc.
