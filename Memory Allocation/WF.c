    Worst Fit Algorithm
        SAMPLE INPUT:

        Enter the number of processes: 4
        Enter the total memory available: 5
        Enter the memory required for each process:
        Process 1: 212
        Process 2: 417
        Process 3: 112
        Process 4: 426
        Enter the memory available for each block:
        Block 1: 600
        Block 2: 500
        Block 3: 300
        Block 4: 200
        Block 5: 100

        Here i have used the same code as First Fit Algorithm, but the only difference is that i have sorted the memory array in descending order.
        That is the only difference between First Fit and Worst Fit Algorithm is that in Worst Fit Algorithm we sort the memory array in descending order.

        try the above input in FF.c
